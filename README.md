# ProjectOverview
The landing page design is responsive, ensuring that it functions properly across various devices and screen sizes. This was achieved through careful styling and layout adjustments. All required user stories were successfully completed. This includes functionalities such as user authentication, account overview, transaction history, and account management features.


# Reflections
Working on the project challenged my problem-solving abilities as I encountered various obstacles and had to find creative solutions to overcome them. This experience helped sharpen my critical thinking skills and taught me how to approach complex tasks systematically.
But, the project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of user needs and preferences by incorporating user stories and feedback into the design process. This user-centric approach helped me create a more intuitive and user-friendly product.

# Overall learning experience
The project provided a valuable opportunity to enhance technical skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Through hands-on practice, I gained a deeper understanding of these technologies and how they can be used to create responsive web pages. Beyond technical skills, the project provided an opportunity for personal growth and development. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, encouraged me to take risks, and ultimately helped me become a more confident and resilient individual.
